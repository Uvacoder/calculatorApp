## My process
first tried to write the HTML then worked on the layout after that added functionality so that simple calculation can be implemented and then made the switch that changes the theme.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- vanillaJS

### Continued development

there can be still some logical error or bugs in the working of Calculator and switch have a room of improvement.
